			In terms of Job opportunities, you can get Jobs opportunity easily as a Java programmer. After learning core java(J2SE) you can learn J2EE (Adv. Java) , Android, Hadoop(Big Data),Spring, Struts & Hibernate etc.

			So if you are not coming from C and C++ background, I will not suggest you to do Java directly. So you must have good basics of C/C++ then you can learn Java really.
